/// \defgroup proj Projections
///
/// Projections in Geometric Algebra take on a particularly simple form.
/// For two geometric entities $a$ and $b$, there are two cases to consider.
/// First, if the grade of $a$ is greater than the grade of $b$, the projection
/// of $a$ on $b$ is given by:
///
/// $$ \textit{proj}_b a = (a \cdot b) \wedge b $$
///
/// The inner product can be thought of as the part of $b$ _least like_ $a$.
/// Using the meet operator on this part produces the part of $b$ _most like_
/// $a$. A simple sanity check is to consider the grades of the result. If the
/// grade of $b$ is less than the grade of $a$, we end up with an entity with
/// grade $a - b + b = a$ as expected.
///
/// In the second case (the grade of $a$ is less than the grade of $b$), the
/// projection of $a$ on $b$ is given by:
///
/// $$ \textit{proj}_b a = (a \cdot b) \cdot b $$
///
/// It can be verified that as in the first case, the grade of the result is the
/// same as the grade of $a$. As this projection occurs in the opposite sense
/// from what one may have seen before, additional clarification is provided
/// below.
